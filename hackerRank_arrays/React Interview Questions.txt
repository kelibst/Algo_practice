React Hooks 
They are a type of functions that allow react functional components to hook onto the state and life cycle features
of react.
React provides built-in hooks like useState, useEffect, useReducer, useRef, use Callback, useContext, and useMemo 
 we can also create your own custom hooks.
React hooks are available from React version of 16.8

advantages of react hooks

useContext help with components tree readability

The "useContext" hook has been a blessing for greatly improving the readability of JSX as it allows context values to be read outside of JSX. 


useEffect combines  effects

instead of using componenentdidmount and later unmount with componenentwillUnmount


Ability to reuse logic
custom hooks are a great way fo shawing logic accross multiple components

So from all the above examples, it's clear that JSX is converted to a React.createElement call and it's then converted to its object representation.
