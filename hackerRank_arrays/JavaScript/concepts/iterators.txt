Javascript Iterators and Generators
Iterators and generators, introduced into JavaScript with ECMAScript 6, represent an extremely useful concept related to iteration in the language. Iterators are objects, abiding by the iterator protocol, that allows us to easily iterate over a given sequence in various ways, such as using the for...of loop. Generators, on the other hand, allow us to use functions and the yield keyword to easily define iterable sequences that are iterators as well.
An iterator is a JavaScript object that implements the iterator protocol.

Now what is the iterator protocol?

The protocol states that the object must have a next() method. This method shall return an object with the following two properties:

done - a Boolean value indicating whether the iterator has reached its last value.
value - holds the next value in a given sequence.
